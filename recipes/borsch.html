    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Make a warming bowl of borsch (also known as borscht or borshch) with this simple and comforting recipe. Serve this hearty soup with a dollop of soured cream and a chunk of crusty bread.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg fatty beef shin, (left in large chunks)</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and left whole</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the <strong>stock</strong>, put the <em>meat</em>, whole onion, bay leaf and 2 litres of lightly salted cold water in a large saucepan. Cook over a very low heat for 1 hr 30 mins or until the beef shin is soft and falls apart easily â€“ this can take up to 3 hrs. Skim off the scum with a spoon from time to time. Break up any larger pieces of beef into the broth, remove the whole onion and discard.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes to the borscht, season well with salt and pepper and cook for 10-15 mins until tender. Meanwhile, heat the sunflower oil in a large, deep frying pan. Add the diced onion and carrot, and cook over a medium heat, stirring, until the carrot is soft and is about to start caramelising.</li>
    </ol>
