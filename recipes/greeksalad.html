    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I love a good green salad – mixed greens, romaine, and kale are some of my favorite starting points for fresh, healthy meals.</p>
    <p>But summer is a time when all vegetables are at their peak. Sweet, juicy tomatoes, snappy bell peppers, and crisp cucumbers abound.</p> 
    <p>This Greek salad recipe showcases these veggies, without any greens to get in the way.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, 
        garlic, oregano, mustard, salt, and several grinds of pepper.</li>
        <li>On a large platter, arrange the cucumber, green pepper, cherry tomatoes,
        feta cheese, red onions, and olives. Drizzle with the dressing and very gently toss.Sprinkle with a few generous pinches of oregano and top with the mint leaves. Season to taste and serve.</li>
    </ol>
